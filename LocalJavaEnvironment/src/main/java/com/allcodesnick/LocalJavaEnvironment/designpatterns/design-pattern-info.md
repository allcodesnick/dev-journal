# [Design Patterns in Java](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/gangs-of-four-gof-design-patterns)

## Creational Design Patterns
There are 5 design patterns in the creational design patterns category.

Pattern Name    |	Description
- Singleton -	The singleton pattern restricts the initialization of a class to ensure that only one instance of the class can be created.(https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/java-singleton-design-pattern-best-practices-examples)
- Factory - The factory pattern takes out the responsibility of instantiating a object from the class to a Factory class.(https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/factory-design-pattern-in-java)
- Abstract Factory - Allows us to create a Factory for factory classes.(https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/abstract-factory-design-pattern-in-java)
- Builder - Creating an object step by step and a method to finally get the object instance.(https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/builder-design-pattern-in-java)
- Prototype - Creating a new object instance from another similar instance and then modify according to our requirements.(https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/prototype-design-pattern-in-java)


## Structural Design Patterns
There are 7 structural design patterns defined in the Gangs of Four design patterns book.

- Pattern Name    |	Description
- Adapter - Provides an interface between two unrelated entities so that they can work together.(https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/adapter-design-pattern-java)
- Composite - Used when we have to implement a part-whole hierarchy. For example, a diagram made of other pieces such as circle, square, triangle, etc.(https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/composite-design-pattern-in-java)
- Proxy - Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.(https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/proxy-design-pattern)
- Flyweight - Caching and reusing object instances, used with immutable objects. For example, string pool.(https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/flyweight-design-pattern-java)
- Facade - Creating a wrapper interfaces on top of existing interfaces to help client applications.(https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/facade-design-pattern-in-java)
- Bridge -The bridge design pattern is used to decouple the interfaces from implementation and hiding the implementation details from the client program.(https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/bridge-design-pattern-java)
Decorator - The decorator design pattern is used to modify the functionality of an object at runtime.(https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/decorator-design-pattern-in-java-example)


## Behavioral- Design Patterns
There are 11 behavioral design patterns defined in the GoF design patterns.

Pattern Name    |	Description
- Template Method - used to create a template method stub and defer some of the steps of implementation to the subclasses.(https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/template-method-design-pattern-in-java)
- Mediator - used to provide a centralized communication medium between different objects in a system.(https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/mediator-design-pattern-java)
- Chain of Responsibility - used to achieve loose coupling in software design where a request from the client is passed to a chain of objects to process them.(https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/chain-of-responsibility-design-pattern-in-java)
- Observer - useful when you are interested in the state of an object and want to get notified whenever there is any change.(https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/observer-design-pattern-in-java)
- Strategy - Strategy pattern is used when we have multiple algorithm for a specific task and client decides the actual implementation to be used at runtime.(https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/strategy-design-pattern-in-java-example-tutorial)
- Command - Command Pattern is used to implement lose coupling in a request-response model.(https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/command-design-pattern)
- State - State design pattern is used when an Object change it’s behavior based on it’s internal state.(https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/state-design-pattern-java)
- Visitor - Visitor pattern is used when we have to perform an operation on a group of similar kind of Objects.(https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/visitor-design-pattern-java)
- Interpreter - defines a grammatical representation for a language and provides an interpreter to deal with this grammar.(https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/interpreter-design-pattern-java)
- Iterator - used to provide a standard way to traverse through a group of Objects.(https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/iterator-design-pattern-java)
- Memento - The memento design pattern is used when we want to save the state of an object so that we can restore later on.(https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/memento-design-pattern-java)
