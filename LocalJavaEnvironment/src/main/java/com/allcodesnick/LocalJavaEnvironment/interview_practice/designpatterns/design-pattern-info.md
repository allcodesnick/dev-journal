# [Design Patterns in Java](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/gangs-of-four-gof-design-patterns)

## Creational Design Patterns
There are 5 design patterns in the creational design patterns category.

Pattern Name    |	Description
- [Singleton](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/java-singleton-design-pattern-best-practices-examples) -	The singleton pattern restricts the initialization of a class to ensure that only one instance of the class can be created.
- [Factory](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/factory-design-pattern-in-java) - The factory pattern takes out the responsibility of instantiating a object from the class to a Factory class.
- [Abstract Factory](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/abstract-factory-design-pattern-in-java) - Allows us to create a Factory for factory classes.
- [Builder](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/builder-design-pattern-in-java) - Creating an object step by step and a method to finally get the object instance.
- [Prototype](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/prototype-design-pattern-in-java) - Creating a new object instance from another similar instance and then modify according to our requirements.


## Structural Design Patterns
There are 7 structural design patterns defined in the Gangs of Four design patterns book.

- Pattern Name    |	Description
- [Adapter](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/adapter-design-pattern-java) - Provides an interface between two unrelated entities so that they can work together.
- [Composite](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/composite-design-pattern-in-java) - Used when we have to implement a part-whole hierarchy. For example, a diagram made of other pieces such as circle, square, triangle, etc.
- [Proxy](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/proxy-design-pattern) - Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
- [Flyweight](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/flyweight-design-pattern-java) - Caching and reusing object instances, used with immutable objects. For example, string pool.
- [Facade](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/facade-design-pattern-in-java) - Creating a wrapper interfaces on top of existing interfaces to help client applications.
- [Bridge](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/bridge-design-pattern-java) -The bridge design pattern is used to decouple the interfaces from implementation and hiding the implementation details from the client program.
- [Decorator](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/decorator-design-pattern-in-java-example) - The decorator design pattern is used to modify the functionality of an object at runtime.


## Behavioral- Design Patterns
There are 11 behavioral design patterns defined in the GoF design patterns.

Pattern Name    |	Description
- [Template Method](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/template-method-design-pattern-in-java) - used to create a template method stub and defer some of the steps of implementation to the subclasses.
- [Mediator](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/mediator-design-pattern-java) - used to provide a centralized communication medium between different objects in a system.
- [Chain of Responsibility](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/chain-of-responsibility-design-pattern-in-java) - used to achieve loose coupling in software design where a request from the client is passed to a chain of objects to process them.
- [Observer](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/observer-design-pattern-in-java) - useful when you are interested in the state of an object and want to get notified whenever there is any change.
- [Strategy](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/strategy-design-pattern-in-java-example-tutorial) - Strategy pattern is used when we have multiple algorithm for a specific task and client decides the actual implementation to be used at runtime.
- [Command](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/command-design-pattern) - Command Pattern is used to implement lose coupling in a request-response model.
- [State](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/state-design-pattern-java) - State design pattern is used when an Object change it’s behavior based on it’s internal state.
- [Visitor](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/visitor-design-pattern-java) - Visitor pattern is used when we have to perform an operation on a group of similar kind of Objects.
- [Interpreter](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/interpreter-design-pattern-java) - defines a grammatical representation for a language and provides an interpreter to deal with this grammar.
- [Iterator](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/iterator-design-pattern-java) - used to provide a standard way to traverse through a group of Objects.
- [Memento](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/memento-design-pattern-java) - The memento design pattern is used when we want to save the state of an object so that we can restore later on.
