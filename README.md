- **Third-Party Integration Strategies:** Integrate external services securely and efficiently.
- **Enterprise-wide Logging and Log Aggregation:** Centralize logs for effective monitoring and troubleshooting.
- **Continuous Testing Strategies:** Extend testing practices beyond unit tests, including integration and performance testing.

## Session Management
- **Session Management:** Implement a secure session management mechanism.
- **Session Security:** Encrypt sessions and protect against session hijacking and fixation attacks.
- **Session Timeout:** Define appropriate session timeout periods for security and user experience.
- **Session Storage:** Choose secure storage options for session data.
- **Token-based Authentication:** Consider using tokens for stateless communication and scalability.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Implement SSO for seamless user authentication across applications.
- **Centralized Session Management:** Centralize session management for consistency in distributed systems.
- **Session Monitoring:** Detect and address anomalies or suspicious activities related to user sessions.
- **Concurrency Control:** Guard against session data inconsistencies due to simultaneous access.
- **Session Logging:** Log relevant session activities for troubleshooting and auditing.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection:** Protect against CSRF attacks compromising session integrity.
- **Session Revocation:** Provide mechanisms to revoke or invalidate sessions on logout or security incidents.
